                        <p className='card-text'>Hello. I’m Robbie, and I am a creator. But as most humans do, I started off a destroyer. I played mad scientist every time I took apart microscopes, flashlights, old game consoles, and anything else I could get away with. I ripped open electronics, dug around their insides, and was sometimes kind enough to put them back together. I didn’t have that iconic, mad scientist “It’s alive!” creation moment, however, until a lot later in life. Becoming a welder was rather like the end of my destroyer days and the start of my creator ones. Welding gave me the zeal to rekindle lost childhood passions like drawing and playing guitar, and it at last gave me my iconic mad scientist moment by giving me a passenger-train-sized way in which to build.</p>
                        <p className='card-text'>My transition into software engineering was almost seamless. My spouse was enrolled in a beginner web development course, and after a week or two of trying my hand at her coursework I was struck with the realization that “I could do this”. Only a short time later and now I’m suddenly building full-stack applications; consuming equal amounts coffee and JavaScript, I am continually increasing my profiency with React, HTML, CSS, API implementation, Node.JS, Express, PostgreSQL, Git, and frameworks like Bootstrap. Outside of my technical competencies, my time as a welder gave me experience with detail-oriented builds, keeping client satisfaction a top priority, and managing large-scale builds and tight deadlines, all of which improved my effectiveness in team collaboration to give me a head start in this new career path of mine.</p>
                        <p className='card-text'>At the end of the day, though, I’m neither a welder nor a software engineer. I’m just Robbie Woolf—hobbies-enthusiast, dog parent of three, environmentalist, horror-genre fanatic, and spicy food devotee.</p>
